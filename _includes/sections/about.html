<div>
    Started out as a geographer, fell in love with geospatial data and am now working on machine learning, natural language
    processing (NLP) and GIS using python, postgresql and docker in AWS serverless environments. I have proven experience in
    data engineering and ETL designing, building, testing and deploying text-processing pipelines.
