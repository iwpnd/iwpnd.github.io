<h1><span data-i18n="skills.my_skills">About</span></h1>

<div>
    I am a geographer that fell in love with spatial data as a spatial data engineer. 
    Eventually I wanted to advance my career and taught myself programming, data engineering and machine learning. 
    I got a job with those skills and was able to sharpen them in a professional environment. 
    Today I'm still learning and I really hope that never stops.
