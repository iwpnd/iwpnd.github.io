# Summary

Geographer turned Geospatial Engineer turned Data-Something with a strong emphasis on data analysis, data engineering and ETL development who is currently working on machine learning in natural language processing for named entity recognition. I got a profound eduction in geospatial data science and GI-systems, but I'm entirely self-taught in Python since early 2017 and the scipy ecosystem including machine learning and the cloud computing on Amazon AWS since late 2017. I just love me some pandas.
